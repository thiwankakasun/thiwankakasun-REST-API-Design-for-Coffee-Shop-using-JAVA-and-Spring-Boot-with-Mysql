# thiwankakasun-REST-API-Design-for-Coffee-Shop-using-JAVA-and-Spring-Boot-with-Mysql
I create a mobile application to allow coffee shop customers to order coffee online. I Create simple DB Structure to store the product details.I Create simple REST API to view products and place a new order. I Use Spring Boot as the framework to develop the REST API. I Use MySQL as the Database.


In this RST web services APIs for CRUD operations on a MySQL database. 
The CRUD operations include Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete. 
By completing this tutorial, you will be able to build a Spring Boot-based web application that exposes RESTful CRUD APIs to clients. 
The following technologies will be used: 
• Spring Boot: greatly simplifies Java enterprise application and RESTful APIs development by providing default configuration and best practices. 
• Spring Data JPA: simplifies programming for the data access layer by implementing most common persistence operations following best practices. 
• Hibernate: is the default Object/Relational Mapping framework integrated with Spring Data JPA. 
To follow this tutorial, you must have the following software programs installed on your computer: 
• Java Development Kit (JDK 1.8 or newer) 
• MySQL Database server (including MySQL Workbench and MySQL Command Line Client to manage database) 
• A Java IDE (Eclipse IDE, NetBeans or IntelliJ IDEA) 
• curl (to test RESTful APIs)

1.	Insert MySQL Database to xamp or wamp.It is attached the this file (database name=coffee_shop) 

2. 	Now we can run the Application class and test. With Eclipse, you can see the Spring Boot logo appears in the Console view. 

3. 	We’ve started Tomcat server on localhost with its default port 8080. Let’s check it out in our browser: http://localhost:8080 You can change the port using application.properties is set server.port=8181 

4. 	We can show the list of coffee items, http://localhost:8080/products/ 

5. 	We can search the products by using id http://localhost:8080/products/{id}

6.	We can order the product by using postman select by POST http://localhost:8080/orders/add we have to enter body tab form data or else
	  We can update the order by using postman select by PUT http://localhost:8080/orders/update/{id}
	  We can update the order by using postman select by PUT http://localhost:8080/orders/delete/{id}
